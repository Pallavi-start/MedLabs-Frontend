                    <li>Late fee policy: ₹100 fixed fine after the 10th, plus ₹50 per day of delay. For example:

                    <li>Payments received will be adjusted against fines first; remaining balance toward actual fees. If fines consume the payment, fees are still considered pending.</li>
